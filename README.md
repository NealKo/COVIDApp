### COVID-19 Information Web App

**Team Members**: Puyuan Zhang, Surya Jagannadh Jatavallabhula, Neal Kornreich, Jonathan Prindle

**Vision Statement:** The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to lockdowns, mass unemployment, and widespread panic as people lack the information to properly understand the risk and protect themselves from the pandemic. Our app will help mitigate this lack of information by providing up-to-date status information from the WHO on the current state of the pandemic and how you can protect yourself.

**Motivation:** To help inform the public about COVID-19.

**Risks:** New programming platform for many members. Relatively new programming language. Unreliable APIs.

**Mitigation:** Read the documentation for Django and Python. Use official APIs if possible.

**Development Method:** Will utilize Scrum. Daily check inâ€™s will occur via slack. Biweekly sprints, will check in via zoom and slack. 

**Project Tracking Software:** Github
